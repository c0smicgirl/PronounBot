help = ***Help for Bontje the pronoun bot***

  {"**General Info:**"}

  Bontje is a bot to manage pronoun roles

  All commands that take a language flag can take
  `language:<language>`, `lang:<language>` or `l:<language>`, where
  language can be an iso code (like *deu* or *de*) or the English name
  (like *German*)

  Where commands take pronouns you do not have to enter all forms of a
  pronoun, Bontje will guess, and ask when there's multiple
  possibilities
